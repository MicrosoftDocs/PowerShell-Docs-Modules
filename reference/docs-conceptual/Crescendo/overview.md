# Microsoft.PowerShell.Crescendo overview

PowerShell is capable of invoking native applications like any shell. However, it would improve the
experience if the native command could participate in the PowerShell pipeline and take advantage of
the parameter behaviors that are part of PowerShell.

The PowerShell Crescendo module provides a way to take advantage of the PowerShell pipeline by
invoking the native executable, facilitating parameter handling, and converting text output into
objects.
