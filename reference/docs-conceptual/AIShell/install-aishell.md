## Install AI Shell

For convenience, you can use `installaishell.ps1` script to install AI Shell.

On Windows, this script:

- Installs `aish.exe` to `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\AIShell` and adds it to your PATH
- Installs the **AIShell** module to your module path location

On macOS, this script:

- Installs the `aish` executable to `/usr/local/AIShell` and creates a symbolic link to
  `/usr/local/bin/aish`.

> [!NOTE]
> This script only works on Windows and Mac systems. Linux users need to follow the manual
> installation instructions.

```powershell
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-aishell.ps1') }"
```

To uninstall AI Shell, invoke the same expression with the `-Uninstall` parameter.

```powershell
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-aishell.ps1') } -Uninstall"
```
