# OpenAI agent

This agent is designed to provide a user-friendly platform for interacting with OpenAI services. It
can connect to a public OpenAI service or a private deployment of the Azure OpenAI service. We
recommend using an Azure OpenAI deployment for enhanced security and privacy.

## Prerequisites

- For OpenAI, you need the **Model Name** and **API Key** to use the agent.
  - [OpenAI API Key][09]
  - [OpenAI Model][10]

- For Azure OpenAI Service, you need the **Endpoint**, **Deployment Name**, **Model Name**, and
  **API Key** to use the agent.
  - [Access to Azure OpenAI][03]
  - [Create an Azure OpenAI deployment][01]

## Configuration

Before getting started, you need to configure the agent with the details of your OpenAI
implementation. To configure the agent, use the `/agent config openai-gpt` command to open
configuration file in your default editor.

- Azure OpenAI requires the `endpoint`, `deployment` name, and the `model` name.
- Public OpenAI only requires the `model` name. No endpoint, no deployment name.

Update the file based on the following example:

```jsonc
{
  // Declare GPT instances.
  "GPTs": [
    // To use the Azure OpenAI service:
    // - Set `Endpoint` to the endpoint of your Azure OpenAI service,
    //     or the endpoint to the Azure API Management service if you are using it as a gateway.
    // - Set `Deployment` to the deployment name of your Azure OpenAI service.
    // - Set `ModelName` to the name of the model used for your deployment, e.g. "gpt-4-0613".
    // - Set `Key` to the access key of your Azure OpenAI service,
    //     or the key of the Azure API Management service if you are using it as a gateway.
    {
      "Name": "ps-az-gpt4",
      "Description": "A GPT instance with expertise in PowerShell scripting and command line utilities. Use gpt-4 running in Azure.",
      "Endpoint": "<insert your Azure OpenAI endpoint>",
      "Deployment": "<insert your deployment name>",
      "ModelName": "<insert the model name>",   // required field to infer properties of the service, such as token limit.
      "Key": "<insert your key>",
      "SystemPrompt": "1. You are a helpful and friendly assistant with expertise in PowerShell scripting and command line.\n2. Assume user is using the operating system `Windows 11` unless otherwise specified.\n3. Use the `code block` syntax in markdown to encapsulate any part in responses that is code, YAML, JSON or XML, but not table.\n4. When encapsulating command line code, use '```powershell' if it's PowerShell command; use '```sh' if it's non-PowerShell CLI command.\n5. When generating CLI commands, never ever break a command into multiple lines. Instead, always list all parameters and arguments of the command on the same line.\n6. Please keep the response concise but to the point. Do not overexplain."
    },

    // To use the public OpenAI service:
    // - Ignore the `Endpoint` and `Deployment` keys.
    // - Set `ModelName` to the name of the model to be used.
    // - Set `Key` to be the OpenAI access token.
    // For example:
    {
        "Name": "ps-gpt4o",
        "Description": "A GPT instance with expertise in PowerShell scripting and command line utilities. Use gpt-4o running in OpenAI.",
        "ModelName": "gpt-4o",
        "Key": "<insert your key>",
        "SystemPrompt": "1. You are a helpful and friendly assistant with expertise in PowerShell scripting and command line.\n2. Assume user is using the operating system `Windows 11` unless otherwise specified.\n3. Use the `code block` syntax in markdown to encapsulate any part in responses that is code, YAML, JSON or XML, but not table.\n4. When encapsulating command line code, use '```powershell' if it's PowerShell command; use '```sh' if it's non-PowerShell CLI command.\n5. When generating CLI commands, never ever break a command into multiple lines. Instead, always list all parameters and arguments of the command on the same line.\n6. Please keep the response concise but to the point. Do not overexplain."
    }
  ],

  // Specify the default GPT instance to use for user query.
  "Active": "ps-az-gpt4"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The endpoint for the Azure OpenAI configuration doesn't need a full endpoint including the
> deployment, for example you can just use the following endpoint format,
> `https://<YourServiceName>.openai.azure.com`.

### Support for Microsoft Entra ID authentication

To keep password and keys secure, weâ€™ve added support for Entra ID authentication to to Azure OpenAI
instances. Now you can access your Azure OpenAI resource without storing keys in the configuration
file. The following example shows how to configure Entra ID authentication:

```json
{
  // Declare GPT instances.
  "GPTs": [
      // Declaration of an Azure OpenAI instance with EntraID authentication
      {
        "Name": "ps-az-entraId",
        "Description": "A GPT instance with expertise in PowerShell scripting using Entra ID authentication.",
        "Endpoint": "<Your Endpoint>",
        "Deployment": "<Your Deployment Name>",
        "ModelName": "<Your Model Name>",
        "AuthType": "EntraID",
        "SystemPrompt": "You are a helpful and friendly assistant with expertise in PowerShell scripting and command line."
      }
  ],

  // Specify the default GPT instance to use for user query.
  "Active": "ps-az-entraId"
}
```

Azure OpenAI uses the following hierarchy of credentials for authentication:

- `EnvironmentCredential`
- `WorkloadIdentityCredential`
- `ManagedIdentityCredential`
- `SharedTokenCacheCredential`
- `VisualStudioCredential`
- `AzureCliCredential`
- `AzurePowerShellCredential`
- `AzureDeveloperCliCredential`
- `InteractiveBrowserCredential`

For more information about these credentials, see .NET documentation for
[`DefaultAzureCredential`][11].

## GPT

GPTs are tailored versions of base OpenAI models. You use a GPT to provide focused responses based
on the system prompt you give the model. GPTs are configured in the agent's settings file. Each GPT
configuration includes the name, description, targeted OpenAI model, and system prompt for
interaction. The system prompts can be customized to support specific scenarios. Each configuration
allows you to create distinct GPTs tailored to a specific domain or scenario. Furthermore, you can
select different OpenAI models for each GPT as required.

### Command

The command `/gpt` is provided to make it easy to manage the GPTs.

- Run `/gpt use <gpt-name>` to switch to another GPT instance, or run `/gpt use` to choose from the
  available ones.
- Run `/gpt list <gpt-name>` to view the details of a GPT definition, or run `/gpt list` to list all
  available GPTs.

```shell
aish:1> /gpt --help
Description:
  Command for GPT management within the 'openai-gpt' agent.

Usage:
  gpt [command] [options]

Options:
  -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  list <GPT>  List a specific GPT, or all available GPTs.
  use <GPT>   Specify a GPT to use, or choose one from the available GPTs.
```

## Support for other OpenAI-compatible models

With the release of AI Shell v1.0.0-preview.2, the `openai-gpt` agent extends support to third-party
models that follow the OpenAI API specifications, allowing for a more flexible AI experience. Many
of these models are open source tools for running SLMs and LLMs locally. The `openai-gpt` agent now
supports the following models:

- [**Ollama**][08]
- [**LM Studio**][06]
- [**Deepseek**][04]
- [**LocalAI**][07]
- [**Google Gemini**][02]
- [**Grok**][05]

To use these models, you only need to configure the `endpoint`, `key`, and `model` name in the agent
configuration file. The following `openai.agents.config` file contains example configurations for
two of the new AI providers. For more information about endpoints and model names, see the
documentation for the specific model.

With the release of AI Shell v1.0.0-preview.4, the `openai-gpt` agent supports the following
models names:

- `o1`
- `o3`
- `o4-mini`
- `gpt-4.1`
- `gpt-4o`
- `gpt-4`
- `gpt-4-32k`
- `gpt-4-turbo`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`
