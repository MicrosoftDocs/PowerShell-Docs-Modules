# UseApprovedVerbs

**Severity Level: Warning**

## Description

All cmdlets must used approved verbs.

Approved verbs can be found by running the command `Get-Verb`.

Additional documentation on approved verbs can be found in the microsoft docs page
[Approved Verbs for PowerShell Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands).
Some unapproved verbs are documented on the approved verbs page and point to approved alternatives.
Try searching for the verb you used to find its approved form. For example, searching for `Read`,
`Open`, or `Search` leads you to `Get`.

## How

Change the verb in the cmdlet's name to an approved verb.

## Example

### Wrong

```powershell
function Change-Item
{
    ...
}
```

### Correct

```powershell
function Update-Item
{
    ...
}
```
