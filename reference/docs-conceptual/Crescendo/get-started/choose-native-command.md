# Choosing a native command to wrap

Good candidates

- Tool is difficult to use
- The output is difficult to consume
- Is there value in getting the output as an object?
- Does it have good help

Bad candidates

- Talk about IPConfig as a bad choice
- Are there better ways (WMI, some API, etc.)?
- Is the output trivial?
- Is the investment worth the time savings?

Best practices

- Don't reinvent the tool - enhance it
- You don't have to wrap all features of the cmd - choose what is important
