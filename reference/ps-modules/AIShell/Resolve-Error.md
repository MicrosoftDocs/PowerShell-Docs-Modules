# Resolve-Error

## SYNOPSIS
Sends the last error in the current session  for resolution in the connected AIShell window.

## SYNTAX

```
Resolve-Error [-Agent <String>] [-IncludeOutputFromClipboard] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

When an error occurs in the current session, this cmdlet sends the error to the AIShell agent for
resolution. The command sends the full error object to the current AIShell agent session, which
attempts to provide a resolution.

Beginning with theAI Shell v1.0.0-preview.2 release, the `Resolve-Error` cmdlet also works with
error messages output from native commands.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 - Resolves the last error

```powershell
PS> Start-AIShell
