# PlatyPS overview

The PlatyPS module provides cmdlets that allow you to create PowerShell help content in Markdown.
The module creates stub Markdown files for each cmdlet in the target module being documented. You
then edit the Markdown files to include descriptions and examples. Then the Markdown can be
converted to the MAML format used by PowerShell's `Get-Help` cmdlet.
